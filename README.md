Creating a basic calculator in Python can be described as follows:

Get user input for two numbers and the desired operation (e.g., +, -, *, /).
Use conditional statements to perform the chosen operation.
Display the result to the user.
Optionally, use a loop to allow the user to perform multiple calculations.
